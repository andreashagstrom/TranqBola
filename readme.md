# Tranq Bola

Mod request / commission that is not uploaded to my Workshop. 

Will immobilize anything(except creatures with the bIsBoss ticked) for 30 seconds and deal torpor to it. Reusable.

It deals 20 torpor per seconds(600 total). Serverowners can change that with these settings. If you want the base of 20 to be higher, change that value here.
